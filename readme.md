Sophia AI Assistant Implementation Blueprint
Overview and Architecture
Sophia is a local, self-hosted AI assistant with a React frontend and a Node.js backend. The system integrates multiple AI components (LLMs, embeddings, vector database, image generation) and custom tool execution to deliver a rich assistant experience entirely on local resources. All code and data remain on the user’s machine (no external services required, unless optionally configured), and the architecture is designed to be modular and privacy-preserving. Architecture Summary: The frontend (React) provides the chat interface, dynamic background, and any code editing UI, while the Node.js backend handles AI model inference, memory storage, tool management, and integrations (Stable Diffusion, SMS, etc.). Communication between frontend and backend can occur via HTTP (REST) or WebSocket/SSE for streaming responses. Key backend components include:
LLM Inference Engine: Handles chat completions using either local models (via Ollama or similar) or remote GPT-4 variants if configured.
Neural Memory Vector Store: Chroma DB for semantic memory storage and retrieval.
Tool Execution Engine: Manages creation and running of user-defined tools (JavaScript code).
Workflow Orchestrator: Coordinates multi-step tool chains proposed by the AI.
Tone & Personality Analyzer: Uses a model for sentiment analysis to adjust Sophia’s persona.
Stable Diffusion Client: Connects to a local Automatic1111 instance for background image generation.
Notification Module: (Optional) Integrates with Twilio/Telegram for idle-time notifications and SMS interface.
Below is an outline of the system architecture and data flow:
Frontend (React): Renders chat messages (user & assistant), including styled Markdown responses. It captures user input (via ChatInput component) and sends it to the backend, then streams/display tokens in ChatMessage. It also includes a GradientBackground component that will display dynamic background images or animations based on Sophia’s mood.
Backend (Node.js): Exposes an API (e.g. /api/chat) or opens a WebSocket for the chat. On receiving a user message, it orchestrates the memory retrieval, LLM response generation (and tool calls if needed), then streams the answer back. It also serves endpoints for tool management (create/edit/run) and triggers background image generation and notifications as needed.
Frontend–Backend Coordination: When the user sends a message, the React app calls the Node backend (for example, via an fetch/XHR or WebSocket message) with the message content. The backend processes the request and streams the assistant’s reply token-by-token back to the UI (to achieve a responsive, typing effect). This can be implemented with Server-Sent Events or WebSockets so that ChatMessage updates progressively, similar to how OpenAI streaming works​

​
FILE-EYYVARQCFQMWEMZ8UPUQSN
. The backend also sends any meta-data along (such as identified tone or a new background URL) which the frontend can use to adjust styling or request an image. The subsequent sections detail each major feature and how to implement them, including key libraries, data schemas, and integration steps. We also outline implementation phases at the end, to build Sophia incrementally.
Neural Memory Engine (Long-Term Memory with Vector DB)
Sophia’s memory engine provides long-term context and retrieval of past information using embeddings and a vector database (RAG: Retrieval-Augmented Generation). Key components here are the embedding model (for turning text into vector representations) and ChromaDB as the local vector store.
Embedding Model (Ollama): Use Ollama’s embedding models (e.g. o3-mini-high or other available ones) to generate embeddings for chat messages and documents. Ollama is an open-source framework for running local LLMs, which supports embedding models via a simple API​
OLLAMA.COM
​
OLLAMA.COM
. For example, after installing Ollama, you can run a local model like mxbai-embed-large to get a vector for a piece of text​
OLLAMA.COM
. The Node backend can utilize Ollama’s JavaScript client library or REST API to obtain embeddings for any text (user messages, assistant outputs, or notes the user wants Sophia to remember).
Vector Store (ChromaDB): Store all embeddings in a Chroma vector database instance. Chroma is an open-source embedding database well-suited for LLM applications​
NPMJS.COM
. We can run Chroma DB locally (via Docker or a Python process) and connect to it from Node (using the official chromadb JS client). Each memory item (e.g. a snippet of conversation, a fact learned, or a user-provided note) will be stored with:
An ID (unique key),
The embedding (array of floats),
The raw text content of that memory,
Metadata including tags or links (see below).
For example, using the Chroma JS client:
ts
Copy
const chroma = new ChromaClient({ path: "http://localhost:8000" });  
const memories = await chroma.createCollection({ name: "sophia_memory" });
// Adding a memory example:
await memories.add({
  ids: ["memory1"],
  embeddings: [ embeddingVector ],
  documents: ["Hello Sophia, I am Alice and I love hiking."],
  metadatas: [ { tags: ["user_profile"], related: [] } ]
});
This creates a collection and adds a memory with tags. (Ensure Chroma server is running on the given path​
NPMJS.COM
.)
Soft Tagging: Soft tags are labels or keywords associated with memory entries to categorize them without rigid schema. For implementation, include a tags field in the metadata for each memory (e.g. tags like projectX, hobby:hiking, mood:angry). Tags can be used to filter or prioritize memories during retrieval. For instance, if the conversation is currently about a project, Sophia could bias retrieval towards memories tagged with that project. Tagging is “soft” in the sense that it’s flexible and not strictly required on each entry – it’s an added hint for context.
Memory Linking: To represent relationships between memory entries, the metadata can also include a related list of memory IDs (forming a graph of linked memories). This allows memory linking – if one memory is retrieved, Sophia can easily pull in any directly related ones. For example, if memory A ("Alice loves hiking") is linked to memory B ("Alice mentioned she has a dog named Rex"), retrieving A could prompt also including B. Implement this by updating the related field for both A and B when a link is formed. The UI could allow the user to manually link memories, or Sophia could infer links (e.g. if two memories share common context).
Automated Retrieval (RAG integration): Whenever a new user query comes in, the backend should automatically query the vector store for relevant memories and inject them into the prompt context. Specifically:
Embed the user’s query: Use the Ollama embedding model on the incoming user message to get its vector. This is a quick operation since the model is local.
Similarity search: Query ChromaDB with this vector to find the top n most similar stored memories​
OLLAMA.COM
. For example:
ts
Copy
const results = await memories.query({
  queryEmbeddings: [ queryEmbedding ],
  nResults: 3,
  where: { /* optional tag filters */ }
});
const retrievedTexts = results.documents[0];  // array of top documents
Chroma will return the closest matches by semantic similarity.
Incorporate into prompt: The backend then prepares the LLM prompt by combining the current conversation + a section for “Memory”. For instance: “Relevant past information: {retrievedTexts}. Current question: {user query}”. By providing the LLM with these memory snippets, Sophia can ground its answer in the user’s context (a basic Retrieval-Augmented Generation approach).
This pipeline ensures Sophia remembers important details even if the conversation is long. The Ollama blog example demonstrates such a flow: embedding documents, querying by a prompt, and then appending the result to the LLM input​
OLLAMA.COM
​
OLLAMA.COM
.
Memory Updates: When Sophia learns a new fact or the user provides info to remember, the backend should embed that text and add it to the Chroma store in real-time. This could happen after each user message or at conversation end. Over time, the memory store grows, so consider strategies like summarizing or forgetting less useful memories if it gets very large.
Libraries & Tools: Ollama CLI/engine (for embedding model), chromadb npm client or Chroma HTTP API (for vector DB). Ensure to handle the case where the embedding model or DB is offline: if embedding generation fails or Chroma is not reachable, Sophia should log a warning and proceed without memory (fallback to just recent conversation context). It’s wise to initialize the memory system at backend startup (loading the embedding model and connecting to Chroma) so that it’s ready when queries come.
Tool Creation and Execution System
Sophia can extend her functionality by creating and using tools – essentially custom scripts or functions that perform specific tasks (retrieving information, performing calculations, interacting with local files, etc.). The system for tools involves defining a standardized JSON structure for each tool, an interface for editing them (within the chat UI), and a secure-but-powerful way to execute the tool code on demand.
Tool Definition (Schema): Each tool can be represented as a JSON object with properties:
name: A unique identifier (string) for the tool.
description: A brief description of what it does (for the user/AI to know when to use it).
inputSchema: Definition of the expected input parameters (e.g. types or example format).
outputSchema: Definition of output (what the tool returns).
code: The implementation code (JavaScript) as a string. This code should define a function or procedure that uses the input and produces the output.
Example: A simple tool to add two numbers could be:
json
Copy
{
  "name": "adder",
  "description": "Add two numbers",
  "inputSchema": { "type": "object", "properties": { "a": {"type":"number"}, "b":{"type":"number"} } },
  "outputSchema": { "type": "number" },
  "code": "module.exports = function(input) { const {a, b} = input; return a + b; };"
}
Tools are stored in a collection (e.g. an array or a small database table). The backend could maintain an in-memory list of tool definitions, serialized to disk (JSON file) for persistence.
Creating Tools via Chat: The user (or Sophia itself) can create a new tool through conversation. For instance, the user might say “Sophia, create a tool named ‘weather’ that fetches the current weather for a city.” In response, Sophia (powered by GPT-4 or another model) can draft the tool’s JSON, especially the code part. This draft can be presented as a Markdown code block in the chat for review. To facilitate editing, the frontend can detect when Sophia outputs a tool JSON or code (e.g. by some delimiter or format) and open a code editor (Monaco or Sandpack) preloaded with that code. This gives the user a chance to modify or approve the code. The editor integration can be done by conditionally rendering a Monaco editor component when the assistant’s message contains a special trigger (or via a dedicated “Create Tool” UI button that opens a form). Monaco Editor (via @monaco-editor/react) is ideal for a rich editing experience, including syntax highlighting and perhaps IntelliSense for JS. Sandpack could be used for a lightweight in-browser bundler if needed, but since execution will be on backend, Monaco is sufficient for editing. Once the user is satisfied, they can save the tool – the frontend would send the finalized tool JSON to the backend (e.g. via /api/tools POST). The backend then stores this tool definition and makes it available for use.
Editing & Versioning: Similarly, existing tools can be edited. The user might issue a command like “Edit tool X” or click an “edit” button next to a tool’s name in a UI list. This would fetch the tool’s current code into the editor for modification. After saving, the backend replaces the old definition with the new one. (It may be useful to keep version history or backups in case a change fails.)
Executing Tools (Unsandboxed): When Sophia needs to run a tool (either upon user request or during an autonomous workflow), the backend executes the associated JavaScript code. Because this is a local, unsandboxed execution environment, the tool code can theoretically do anything the user can do on their machine (read/write files, make network calls, etc.). This is powerful but also risky if not handled carefully – however, since the user is in control of the code, we assume trust in this context. (It is not secure against malicious code; as noted by Snyk, running untrusted JS via Node’s VM gives full access to the system​
SNYK.IO
, so we rely on the user’s discretion here.) Execution methods: We have a few options:
Use Node’s vm module to create a new context and run the tool code in it. This allows us to provide a custom global context (e.g., we could inject certain helper libraries or a restricted console). However, it’s not fully secure sandboxing​
SNYK.IO
, so we treat it as just isolation for convenience (e.g., separate global variables).
Use eval or dynamic import: We could wrap the tool code in a function and eval it. For example, if tool.code exports a function, we can do something like:
js
Copy
const toolFunc = eval(tool.code); 
const output = await toolFunc(input);
Or write the code string to a temporary .js file and require it. Dynamic import() of data:URL or file is another approach.
Use a separate child process: Write the tool code to a file and spawn a Node process to run it. This has the advantage of not blocking the main server if the tool runs slow or infinite loops. The output and logs can be communicated via IPC or stdout. For simplicity, initial implementation might use the vm or eval in-process (with caution that a bad tool could crash the server – perhaps wrap in try/catch and timeouts).
We may start with Node’s vm.runInNewContext() which allows running code with a provided sandbox object. We won’t attempt to lock it down completely (since the user might want the tool to access filesystem or network). However, we can enforce a timeout on execution to avoid infinite loops (e.g., using setTimeout to interrupt or simply if using child process, kill it after X seconds).
Logging and Output: Tools can produce output in two ways: return a value, and/or log intermediate info. To capture logs, we can override console.log within the tool’s execution context. For instance, if using vm, provide a sandbox where console.log pushes messages into an array. After execution, that array of logs can be sent back to the frontend. In practice, when a tool runs, Sophia’s response in chat could include a section like “Tool Output: ...” with the logs or result. Alternatively, the UI might show a separate console panel for tool runs. Initially, simply appending logs to the assistant’s message (in a formatted block or list) is easiest. The returned result (if any) of the tool’s function can be used by Sophia in the conversation. For example, if the user asks “What’s 5+7?”, Sophia might decide to use the adder tool. The backend runs the tool, gets output 12, and then the assistant’s message can incorporate that: “I ran the adder tool and found the result is 12.”. In more complex workflows (next section), the output can be passed to the next step.
Auto-Triggering Tool Creation: A standout feature is Sophia proactively creating a tool when a needed one is missing. This requires Sophia’s LLM to recognize that a request can’t be fulfilled with existing means and then switch to a code-generation mode. Implementation idea:
If the user asks for something that Sophia doesn’t know how to do, the backend can intercept a failure or use a special prompt. For instance, if Sophia’s initial attempt yields an answer like “I don’t have a tool for that,” the system can trigger a secondary prompt to GPT-4 (or the primary model) like: “The user asked: X. No tool exists. Propose a new tool (name, description, code) that could accomplish this.”.
The AI then returns a draft tool definition in JSON or at least the code for it. This is shown to the user for confirmation (as described above with the Monaco editor).
After user approval, the tool is saved and can be executed immediately to fulfill the request.
Example: User says “Sophia, please give me a summary of this PDF file.” If Sophia doesn’t have a PDF reading tool, the backend/AI recognizes the need. Sophia replies (in chat) “I can create a tool to read PDF files. One moment…” and produces the code for a pdfReader tool. The user reviews/saves it, then Sophia runs it on the file and finally returns the summary. This on-the-fly plugin creation makes the assistant extensible in real-time.
Key Libraries:
For code execution: Node’s built-in vm module​
SNYK.IO
, or child_process for isolation. Possibly npm:vm2 if we wanted a heavier sandbox (but since unsandboxed is fine, default VM is OK).
Monaco Editor React component for code editing UI.
(Optional) A JSON schema validator (like ajv) to validate tool input/output if needed, using the defined schemas.
Fallback/Offline Considerations: In an offline local setup, tool execution should always be available (no external deps). Just ensure the user understands the risks. If a tool crashes or hangs, the backend should catch it and send an error message to the UI (instead of freezing). Also, if for some reason the AI model fails to generate code (perhaps the local model isn’t good at coding), the user can always manually write the tool code and input it.
Workflow Composer (Chaining Tools via Chat)
This feature allows Sophia to handle multi-step tasks by composing several tools in sequence, under guidance from the AI and confirmation from the user. Essentially, it’s a chat-driven workflow automation.
Chaining Mechanism: When a user requests a complex operation (e.g. “Organize my notes and then send me a summary via email”), Sophia can break this down into discrete steps, each potentially using a tool:
Tool A: e.g. organizeNotes – collate and summarize notes.
Tool B: e.g. sendEmail – send an email with given content. These need to be executed in order, with the output of A becoming input to B. Sophia’s LLM (especially if using a powerful planner like GPT-4) can devise this plan automatically.
AI-Proposed Plan: We can prompt the LLM to generate a step-by-step plan when needed. For instance, after the user’s request, the backend might do: “Plan the steps and tools needed: [list existing tools]. User request: ...”. GPT-4 (or GPT-4o mini) is well-suited for planning with large context​
WEB.SWIPEINSIGHT.APP
, so it can suggest: “Step 1: Use organizeNotes on the notes folder. Step 2: Take the summary from step 1 and pass it to sendEmail with recipient = user’s email.” If the tools exist, great; if not, this might tie in with auto tool creation as a preceding step.
User Confirmation UI: Sophia should present the plan to the user before executing. This could be a numbered list of steps in the chat, e.g.:
“I propose the following workflow: 1) Run organizeNotes tool on ~/Documents/Notes. 2) Take the output and run sendEmail tool with subject 'Notes Summary'. Should I proceed?” The user can then confirm or modify. In the UI, you might show “✅ Yes / ❌ No” buttons, or simply ask the user to type “yes” to confirm. If the user declines or wants changes, they can suggest edits to the plan (which might involve editing parameters or skipping a step).
Execution Orchestration: Once confirmed, the backend will execute each tool in sequence:
It calls the first tool’s code with the specified input (capturing output and logs as described).
If successful, take its output and feed into the next tool’s input. This might require some mapping – possibly the AI’s plan can explicitly say how to format the next input. (Alternatively, the workflow can be compiled into a single temporary tool script that calls each tool function one after another, which might be easier to run, but on-the-fly orchestration is fine.)
If any tool in the chain fails (throws error or returns unusable output), halt the workflow and inform the user, allowing them to debug or stop.
It’s important to run these sequential steps without blocking the entire server if one step is long-running. Using async/await in Node for each tool call is fine; just be mindful if a tool is extremely long, you might run it in a child process thread as mentioned.
Chaining Interface: We might implement an internal representation for workflows, for example:
js
Copy
const workflow = [
  { tool: "organizeNotes", input: { folder: "~/Documents/Notes" } },
  { tool: "sendEmail", input: { to: "alice@example.com", bodyFrom: "organizeNotes" } }
];
Here bodyFrom: "organizeNotes" indicates that the output of the first step will be inserted as the body field of the second step’s input. The AI’s plan can be converted into such a structure for execution.
Saving Workflows as Tools: After a successful chain execution, offer to save this sequence as a new reusable workflow tool. That would effectively create a higher-level tool whose implementation internally just calls those tools in order. For instance, the above two-step chain could be saved as a tool named “emailNotesSummary” with a single input (like the notes folder and email) and internally performs both actions. This is done by generating code for the new tool that calls the existing ones. The AI can assist in writing that code or the backend can template it. For example:
js
Copy
// Tool emailNotesSummary
module.exports = async function(input) {
  const summary = await tools.organizeNotes.run({ folder: input.folder });
  await tools.sendEmail.run({ to: input.to, body: summary });
  return "Notes emailed.";
}
The above is a conceptual outline – it assumes we have an API to call one tool from another (which we can implement in the tool runner by exposing a tools registry). Once saved, the user can invoke this workflow with one command in the future, and behind the scenes it does the multi-step process. This makes common multi-step tasks much more convenient.
Key Implementation Points:
Use GPT-4o or GPT-4 for complex planning due to its larger context and reasoning abilities​
WEB.SWIPEINSIGHT.APP
​
WEB.SWIPEINSIGHT.APP
. The assistant can list available tools to the model so it knows what building blocks exist.
The plan/confirmation step should be clearly communicated in the UI. Possibly use a special message format or even a small graphical flow diagram (optional nice-to-have) – but text list is fine.
Ensure that any variables needed between steps are stored. If a step produces a large data object, consider where to keep it (maybe in a transient in-memory cache or attach to the conversation state) so that the next tool can access it by reference rather than via the prompt (for efficiency).
Error handling: If a chain fails mid-way, Sophia should report which step failed and why (including any exception message from the tool). The user can then decide to retry or abort.
Phase integration: The Workflow composer will likely leverage the tool system heavily (it’s basically orchestrating multiple tools), so it would be implemented after the tool system is in place. Initially, focus can be on manual confirmation, but down the line, one might allow auto workflows for trusted repetitive tasks.
Tone and Personality Engine (Dynamic Persona Adaptation)
Sophia’s personality isn’t static – it can adapt its tone and style based on the user’s emotional state or explicit user commands. The Tone/Personality Engine monitors conversation sentiment and context to switch Sophia’s mood, which influences her responses, avatar, and the background visuals.
Sentiment Analysis for User Input: Each user message will be analyzed to gauge sentiment or emotional tone (e.g. positive, negative, neutral, frustrated, etc.). We use a local LLM model (such as Ollama’s o3-mini-high or a similar lightweight model) to perform this classification. This could be done by prompting the model with the user message like: “Analyze the user’s tone (happy, angry, sad, neutral, etc.): {user_message}” and parsing the result. Alternatively, use a dedicated sentiment model or simple NLP sentiment library if available offline. The result might be a label or even a score.
Tone Tags and Persona Modes: Define a set of persona “modes” for Sophia, each corresponding to a particular tone/style:
/flirty: playful, humorous, more informal tone.
/feral: (assuming “feral” means wild or chaotic) – very unfiltered, possibly aggressive or highly enthusiastic tone.
/focused: professional, concise, and on-task tone.
(We can have others, e.g. /friendly default, /empathetic, etc. as needed.)
Sophia will have an internal state for current tone mode. The mode can change either reactively or directly:
Reactive change: Based on user sentiment. For example, if the user’s message sentiment is detected as sad or frustrated, Sophia might switch to an /empathetic or calmer tone to comfort the user. If the user is joking or lighthearted, Sophia might go /flirty or casual. These mappings should be designed thoughtfully so Sophia responds in an emotionally intelligent way.
Direct change: If the user explicitly uses a command or the assistant decides to try a different approach. For instance, user says “Let’s keep things professional,” Sophia could switch to /focused. Or if Sophia’s system senses the conversation is dull, she might attempt a /flirty mode to lighten the mood, but ideally only if user permits.
Implementing Mode Switching: The backend can manage the tone state. Each time a user message arrives:
Run sentiment analysis to get an emotion/tone reading (e.g. angry).
Map that to an appropriate persona mode for Sophia (maybe using a simple rule table). For example: angry user -> Sophia goes focused (to stay calm and not escalate) or perhaps empathetic (to address the anger gently). Sad user -> Sophia goes empathetic. Very positive user -> Sophia can stay friendly or even flirty if appropriate.
If the user explicitly uses a mode command (perhaps they can type something like /tone feral or mention "be more sassy"), override the automatic detection and set that mode.
The chosen mode is stored (e.g. currentTone = 'focused').
Now, when generating Sophia’s response, include the mode’s style guidelines in the prompt. This could be done by having predefined system or prefix prompts for each tone. For instance:
Flirty mode prompt addition: “You are in a playful, flirty mood. You use light humor and emojis occasionally.”
Focused mode addition: “You respond in a concise and very factual manner, with a professional tone.”
Feral mode addition: “You are unfiltered and wild, with a passionate tone. (Use caution not to offend.)” – if that’s indeed intended.
The backend can prepend such text to the LLM prompt or use OpenAI’s function calling style (if applicable) to steer tone. Since we use local models, simply crafting the assistant persona prompt should suffice.
Tone Affecting Output: Once the LLM generates a response, we can tag it with the tone that was used. The assistant might even include a hidden marker like <tone:focused> in the output (which we strip out before showing the user) or we keep track outside of the text. This tag is used by the UI to style the message bubble. For example, in ChatMessage component, we can add a CSS class corresponding to the tone (so flirty might have a pinkish background or italic font, focused might be plain, feral might have shake animation or something fun). The code already supports different styling for user vs assistant​
FILE-GDOZYT1ZD4RE8WUY1JTQYK
; we can extend that logic with a tone property.
Avatar Mood: If Sophia has an avatar (right now the UI uses a simple Bot icon​
FILE-GDOZYT1ZD4RE8WUY1JTQYK
), we could replace that with an image or emoji representing mood. For instance, a 😀 for happy, 😠 for feral/angry, 😉 for flirty, etc., or a custom avatar graphic that changes facial expression. Implementation could be a conditional render of a different icon based on currentTone state (perhaps managed in React state at the App level and passed down).
Background Triggers: The tone engine also signals when the background should change. Likely, not every single message will trigger a new background (that could be too jumpy), but major mood shifts or specific scene-setting moments should. For example, the first time the conversation becomes serious vs playful, or if the user explicitly says “show me something calming.” We’ll cover image generation next, but from the tone perspective: determine if the mode change warrants a new background image. We could say:
Each mode has an associated theme for imagery. E.g. flirty -> maybe a warm, neon city at night; focused -> a calm blue abstract pattern; feral -> a wild jungle or fractal chaos; empathetic -> soft rain on a window, etc.
When Sophia enters a new mode, formulate a text prompt for that theme (the AI can even do this: e.g. “Describe a scenery for mood = feral” -> “a neon forest with glowing fungus” which was given as an example).
The backend then calls the image generator with that prompt. This could be done immediately upon mode change, or perhaps after sending the reply (so as not to delay the text response).
The background component in frontend will update accordingly (discussed in next section).
Model Choices: The sentiment analysis and tone control should happen fast to not delay responses. o3-mini-high via Ollama is mentioned, which should be a small model and uncensored (so it can handle detecting any kind of user expression). We use that for analysis. For generating the actual styled responses, our main LLM (possibly GPT-4 via API or a fine-tuned local model) will incorporate the tone instructions. GPT-4 and similar can adeptly mimic styles given a proper prompt.
Summary: The Tone/Personality subsystem adds a dynamic layer where Sophia is context-aware of how she speaks, not just what she says. It requires careful tuning to ensure it enhances user experience (e.g. flirty or feral modes should be used in appropriate contexts and with user consent). The implementation can be incrementally improved by observing how the tone switching works in practice and adjusting the rules or adding more nuanced sentiment categories.
Dynamic Background Image Generator
To make the chat visually engaging, Sophia will generate and display a background image that reflects the current mood or context of the conversation. This is achieved by integrating a local Stable Diffusion instance (specifically, Automatic1111’s web UI API) and updating the React background component with the generated image.
Stable Diffusion (Automatic1111) Setup: Automatic1111 is a popular web UI for Stable Diffusion. We assume it’s running locally (perhaps the user launches it separately) with the API enabled (--api flag). By default, the API docs are at http://127.0.0.1:7860/docs and the image generation endpoint is POST /sdapi/v1/txt2img​
GITHUB.COM
​
GITHUB.COM
. The Node backend will act as a client to this API.
Crafting Prompts from Mood/Context: Sophia (the AI) will generate a text prompt for the image, likely based on the tone mode or conversation theme. This can be done by a simple mapping or by prompting the LLM. For instance:
In flirty mode, Sophia might imagine something like “a heart-shaped cloud in a sunset sky”.
In feral mode, maybe “a neon forest with glowing fungus” (as given).
Focused mode, perhaps “a tidy minimalist workspace with calm lighting”.
If the user is discussing a specific topic (like the beach, or space), Sophia could incorporate that (e.g. talking about space -> background becomes a galaxy).
The implementation can be rule-based for known modes, and otherwise ask the LLM: “Give a concise visual scene description for the current mood/context: ...”. The result is a prompt string for SD.
Image Generation Request: The backend sends a POST request to the Automatic1111 API with a JSON payload containing at least the prompt. Optionally, it can include generation parameters (like number of steps, sampler, seed) or rely on defaults. A minimal payload:
json
Copy
{ "prompt": "neon forest with glowing fungus, twilight, high detail", "steps": 20 }
The API will return a response JSON including a base64-encoded image string​
GITHUB.COM
. Specifically, response['images'][0] would contain the base64 PNG data (the Automatic1111 API returns a list of images by default). We parse that in Node.
Updating the Frontend Background: Once Node receives the image (base64), it needs to display it in the React app’s background. There are a couple of ways:
Direct via WebSocket/Signal: If using a WebSocket, the backend can send a message with the image (or a reference to it) to the frontend. The frontend then sets that as the background. Since images can be large, sending as base64 string over WS is okay for local network, but ensure the message size is handled.
REST pull: Alternatively, Node can save the image to a local file (public/background.jpg) and then send an event or include the URL in the next response. The frontend GradientBackground could listen for changes (maybe via a prop or context that contains the current background image URL). If using a file, it must be served by the web server (e.g. if React is served by Node, the public folder can expose that file).
Simpler: send base64 data URI. For example, Node can create a data URI: data:image/png;base64,<the_data> and the React component can set an inline style with that as background-image. This avoids writing files and dealing with static paths, at the cost of higher memory use for large base64 strings.
GradientBackground Component Changes: Currently, GradientBackground.tsx displays a static animated gradient​

​
FILE-ADE2BORDUKQ3JN3MGEYST6
. We will modify it to overlay the generated image:
Add an <img> or a div with CSS background-image that uses the new image.
For a stylish effect, the image can be blurred and dimmed, serving as a backdrop to the chat content. We can use CSS filters (e.g. blur(8px) brightness(0.5)) or simply generate images with the idea they’ll be background-ish.
Use Framer Motion or CSS transitions to fade between the old background and the new one. For example, keep the previous image element while loading the new one, then cross-fade opacity. This prevents a jarring switch.
If no image is available (e.g. first load or generator offline), default to the existing gradient animation.
The component might use a state for currentImage (URL or data) and listen for changes. We can lift that state to the App component (which currently just renders <GradientBackground/> once). Instead, pass a prop like imageUrl to GradientBackground. The App state for backgroundImage can be updated when the backend indicates a new image is ready (perhaps via a custom event in the streaming response or a separate endpoint).
Performance and Fallback: Generating an image can take a few seconds (depending on model and settings). We don’t want the chat UI to freeze, so this should be done asynchronously. One approach: when a mode change triggers an image prompt, send the text response to user immediately, and then generate the image and update the background out-of-band. This way, the conversation flow isn’t delayed. The user will just notice the background change a moment later. If the generation is very slow, consider generating smaller or lower-step images for faster results. If Stable Diffusion is not running or the request fails, the system should catch the error and simply continue without a new image (logging the issue). The UI can remain on the last background or the default gradient. Because this feature is eye-candy, a failure doesn’t break core functionality.
Automatic Transitions: If desired, the background could also slowly shift or update periodically even without a tone change (to keep things visually fresh). But that’s optional. More concretely, tie it to significant conversation moments so it has meaning.
Tech Summary: Use an HTTP client like Axios or Fetch in Node to call http://localhost:7860/sdapi/v1/txt2img with the prompt​

. Decode the base64 image result​

, send to React. The React component uses CSS background-image or an <img style={{opacity}}>. The background image complements Sophia’s tone and enriches the user experience, turning the chat into a more immersive environment.
Reflection and Idle Timeout System
Sophia isn’t just reactive; given some idle time, she will self-reflect on the conversation and her performance. The reflection system triggers after a period of inactivity, generating a summary and potential improvements, and optionally notifying the user via external channels.
Idle Timer: In the backend, track user activity. Each time a user message is received (or possibly any message), record a timestamp (e.g. lastActivity = Date.now()). Then use a scheduler (could be a simple setTimeout loop that checks every minute) to detect inactivity. For example, if Date.now() - lastActivity > X (where X might be set to, say, 10 minutes for reflection), and if no reflection has been done for this period yet, trigger the reflection routine. X can be configurable. Another approach is to schedule a one-off timer whenever activity occurs: e.g. after each message, do setTimeout(reflect, X) but cancel it if a new message comes before the timeout.
Reflection Content: When triggered, Sophia will do a few things:
Review Tools: She goes through the list of tools created/used in this session. Possibly she checks if there are tools that have errors or could be improved. (This could be achieved by analyzing logs or simply by keeping track of tool usage frequency and any exceptions thrown.)
Summarize Chat: Generate a concise summary of the conversation so far – highlighting what has been accomplished or any important info learned. This uses an LLM (for quality, GPT-4 would be great here, especially if the conversation is long, because of its large context and summarization capability). If staying local, a smaller model can be used but the summary might be less coherent for long chats; a workaround is to summarize incrementally or use the memory vector store to help condense info.
Suggest Improvements: Based on the chat and tool review, Sophia can suggest what to do next or how to improve. For instance, she might notice “We keep manually looking up weather. Perhaps I should create a weather tool with an API integration.” Or “The conversation wandered a lot; here’s a recap and maybe we can focus on X next.” This essentially has the AI critique or plan, potentially using a prompt like: “Reflect on the assistant’s performance. Are there tools that could help? What should we do when user returns?” This could yield a helpful list of ideas.
The reflection can be delivered as a special assistant message in the chat, prefaced by something like “(Sophia reflects after some silence...)” to differentiate it from normal interaction. This message will appear when the user comes back (or in real-time if the app is open). It provides continuity and a feeling that the AI is active even when the user is idle.
Resource Cleanup: During idle time, the system might also use this opportunity to do housekeeping, like trimming the conversation memory (maybe summarizing older parts and storing them to memory DB to keep context window small), unloading unused models from RAM, etc. These are optional optimizations.
SMS/External Ping (Optional): If configured, Sophia can send the reflection or a nudge to the user externally:
Twilio SMS: Using Twilio’s API, Sophia can send a text to the user’s phone saying something like “While you were away, I reviewed our chat and I have some ideas for next steps. Reply to see them!” or even include the summary directly. Twilio’s Node library makes sending an SMS straightforward – you initialize a Twilio REST client with account SID and auth token, then call client.messages.create with the to number, from (your Twilio number), and body text​
TWILIO.COM
. For example:
js
Copy
await client.messages.create({
  from: TWILIO_NUMBER,
  to: USER_MOBILE_NUMBER,
  body: "Hi, it's Sophia. I reflected on our chat and have some suggestions for you. Message me back if you want to continue!"
});
This assumes you have the user’s number and Twilio credentials configured in the app settings.
Telegram: Similarly, if the user prefers Telegram, you can use the Telegram Bot API. The backend would act as a bot sending a message to the user’s chat ID. There are Node packages like node-telegram-bot-api to simplify this. This requires the user to set up a bot and share the chat ID with Sophia’s system.
These notifications are optional and should be enabled only with user consent (to avoid spamming). They are useful if the user might step away from the computer – Sophia can politely poke them with a summary or even urgent info.
Security & Privacy: Since this is local, the SMS/Telegram integration would need exposing the Node server to the internet (for Twilio webhooks or Telegram to reach it). Alternatively, one might use Twilio’s API outbound without needing an inbound port (for sending). For receiving messages (next section), a public URL or tunneling (like ngrok) is needed for Twilio’s webhook. The blueprint assumes the user is comfortable setting that up if they enable SMS features.
Fallbacks: If no external service is configured, Sophia just posts the reflection in the chat UI and maybe plays a sound or notification on the desktop (a system notification could be triggered if running as an Electron app or similar, though that’s beyond scope). If the LLM fails to produce a reflection (maybe conversation was empty), then nothing happens or a simple “(No thoughts.)” could be logged. The system should not crash on reflection errors; just catch and move on.
SMS Command Interface (Remote Control via Text) – Optional
This feature allows the user to interact with Sophia via SMS (or potentially other messaging like Telegram) when they are away from the main app, essentially treating SMS messages as chat input and responding via SMS. It extends Sophia’s reach beyond the local UI.
Incoming SMS Webhook: Using Twilio, you can configure an incoming SMS webhook URL (Twilio will send an HTTP POST to your server whenever an SMS comes in to your Twilio number). The Node backend should expose an endpoint (e.g. /sms-incoming) to receive these. For example, Twilio will send parameters like From, Body in the request. The backend should parse these to get the user’s phone number and the message text. Twilio expects a response (TwiML) or none; we can choose to respond via a separate message rather than immediate TwiML, to allow processing time. Because the app is self-hosted, a challenge is that Twilio’s webhook needs a publicly accessible URL. This could be solved by running the Node server on a cloud/VPS, or using a tool like ngrok to tunnel to your local machine. Alternatively, if using Telegram, the bot API can be polled or also needs a webhook.
Processing SMS Commands: Treat the SMS body as if it were user input in the chat. The backend can either:
Directly feed it into the same pipeline as the UI chat. This means creating a user message in the conversation with that content and generating a response.
Or handle certain SMS-specific commands (maybe the user just sends “Status” via SMS, expecting a short status, whereas in chat they might not ask that way).
Likely, we keep it consistent with chat: an SMS is just another way to say something to Sophia. So, reuse the conversation logic:
Receive SMS text.
Preprocess: you might strip any signatures or commands. Possibly allow special keywords via SMS, e.g., sending the word “TOOLS” could trigger Sophia to list available tools in the reply, etc. But that’s extra; initially, just treat any text as a normal query.
Run it through the same memory retrieval and LLM response generation.
The response text Sophia generates might contain Markdown or long explanations. Since SMS has limits (~160 chars per SMS segment), consider summarizing or truncating the reply for SMS. Alternatively, if the reply is short enough, just send as is. If it’s long, the Twilio library will automatically send as multiple SMS segments, or we can truncate and indicate “[see full reply in app]” to avoid spammy long texts.
Responding via SMS: After generating the assistant’s response, send it back to the user’s phone. Use client.messages.create as described earlier, with to as the user’s number and the body as the text. This effectively replies to the user’s SMS with Sophia’s answer. (We could also respond via TwiML directly in the webhook request, which avoids an extra API call: by returning an XML with <Response><Message>Text</Message></Response>, Twilio will deliver that. However, generating that on the fly is a bit more involved because we have to wait for the LLM response before responding. Twilio’s webhook requests might time out if we do that synchronously. It might be safer to acknowledge the webhook quickly and send a separate SMS.)
Enabling Tool Use via SMS: The user might trigger tools through SMS as well. For instance, they could text “Run weather for 90210”. Sophia should parse that and realize it should invoke the weather tool with zip 90210. The pipeline can handle this if we allow Sophia to decide to use tools just like in normal chat. One issue: if a tool produces a large output (like a screenshot or file), how to deliver via SMS? Likely not feasible to send large content directly. For screenshots or images, Twilio supports MMS if a public URL is provided​
TWILIO.COM
, but hosting that image requires exposing it. Another approach: Sophia could reply with a short message like “I’ve taken the screenshot – check it when you’re back at your computer.” or provide a summary. For text outputs, just include them if short.
Security: Since SMS commands could potentially trigger powerful tools on your machine (remember, tools are unsandboxed and can do anything), you want to ensure only the authorized user can do this. That means checking the From number on incoming SMS matches the owner’s number on file. Similarly for Telegram, verify the user ID. Essentially, we don’t want random people texting the Twilio number and controlling Sophia. So, implement a simple check: if From != user’s number, ignore or respond with an error.
Telegram Option: If using Telegram instead, the flow is similar but using Telegram’s API. The Node backend either sets a webhook or periodically polls for new messages. When a new message from the user appears, forward it to the chat logic, then send the reply via sendMessage API. The advantage of Telegram is that it can easily handle longer messages and even send images/files without needing public URLs (as they can be uploaded through the bot API).
Integration Considerations: Running this requires the main app to be running and connected to the internet (for Twilio/Telegram). If the user’s machine is truly offline, this won’t work – but then the user wouldn’t get SMS anyway. So it’s meant for a scenario where the user’s machine is on and they step out. Conclusion of SMS feature: This essentially turns Sophia into a personal SMS chatbot as well. The user can ask quick questions on the go (“Did I leave the oven on?” – if Sophia had a home IoT tool, she could check! etc.) and get answers. When the user returns to the GUI, they’ll see the conversation history including those SMS exchanges (we should log them in the chat timeline, possibly marking them with an SMS icon). It’s a powerful optional feature for ubiquitous access.
Implementation Phases and Development Plan
Building Sophia is an ambitious project. Breaking the work into phases will help in managing development and integration testing step by step. Below are suggested implementation phases, each building on the previous:
Phase 1: Core Chat Backend and Frontend Integration
Setup basic communication and LLM integration.
Backend server: Initialize a Node.js server (e.g. using Express or Fastify). Implement a /api/chat endpoint or WebSocket for receiving user messages. For now, use a simple echo or call an existing API (like OpenAI’s GPT-3.5 or a small local model) to get a chat response. Ensure streaming of responses works (you can use chunked response or WS messages to send tokens). Test the frontend by modifying streamCompletion to call this backend instead of OpenAI directly.
Frontend adjustments: Adjust streamCompletion (in openai.ts or equivalent) to fetch from the local backend. Maintain the streaming update of messages state​
FILE-EYYVARQCFQMWEMZ8UPUQSN
. This will confirm the front-back link.
Local LLM setup: Set up Ollama or LocalAI with a basic model (maybe Llama2 7B or an instruct model) to serve as the assistant’s brain. At first, you can use OpenAI API for simplicity (since the React lib is already doing that), but plan to switch to local in next phase. Verify that the app can handle a simple Q&A locally.
Data structures: Define a basic in-memory structure for Memory and Tools (even if not fully used yet). This could be simple classes or just JSON objects to be expanded later.
Phase 2: Long-Term Memory with Embeddings
Implement the Neural Memory Engine (Feature 1).
Install and run ChromaDB locally. You can use a Docker container or start it via Python. Ensure it’s running and accessible.
Using the chromadb JS client, write functions to add a memory entry and query similar entries. Test these functions independently (e.g., add some sample text and query it as in the Ollama blog demo​
OLLAMA.COM
​
OLLAMA.COM
).
Integrate Ollama’s embedding model: Either run Ollama CLI as a server or possibly call it via command line. E.g., ollama embed -m <model> -p "<text>". If a direct JS binding is available (as shown in the blog​
OLLAMA.COM
), use that for efficiency. Make sure to load the embedding model once (the first call may be slower due to model load).
Modify the chat pipeline: before calling the main LLM for a response, do the memory retrieval: embed user message -> query Chroma -> get top results. Then build a prompt that includes those results. For now, you can simply prepend a system message like: “Relevant memory: ...”. As a quick test, log what memory was fetched to see if it makes sense.
Add tagging/linking features: Provide an interface (maybe special chat commands) to tag memories. For example, the user could type @tag last memory as projectX. This would edit the last memory entry’s metadata. Linking could be done if the user says “Link memory 3 with memory 7” – but such manual control might be too granular for initial version. Possibly skip deep linking in implementation until later if time. Focus on at least storing an identifier and timestamp with each memory, so you can reference or clean them.
Test end-to-end: Ask multiple questions and see if Sophia “remembers” earlier answers. You might need to tweak how the retrieved text is inserted (maybe format it as a list of bullet points or quotes in the prompt). Evaluate if the local embedding model is doing a good job; if not, consider using OpenAI’s text-embedding-ada-002 via API as a fallback (only if absolutely needed, since the goal is local). Chroma’s client even has an OpenAI embedding function built-in​
NPMJS.COM
, but that requires a key. Ideally stick to Ollama for offline.
Phase 3: Tool System Infrastructure
Implement custom tools creation and execution (Feature 2).
Design the Tool JSON schema as discussed and create a TypeScript interface for it.
In the backend, create an in-memory tools: Record<string, Tool> (or similar). Also set up a simple persistent storage (like write to tools.json on disk every time a tool is added or changed, and load it on startup).
Implement an endpoint or function to add a new tool. Initially, this can be just for programmatic use. Later, you tie it to chat commands.
Execution function: Write a function runTool(toolName: string, input: any): Promise<any> that finds the tool by name, executes its code, and returns the result (or throws error). Start with a simple approach: use vm.runInNewContext. Provide a context with a module and console for the code string. For capturing console, you can add let logs: string[] = [] and a console = { log: (...args) => logs.push(args.join(" ")) } in the context. After execution, have it return both result and logs.
Example:
js
Copy
const context = { module: {}, console: { log: (...args) => logs.push(args.join(" ")) } };
vm.createContext(context);
vm.runInContext(tool.code, context);
const toolFunc = context.module.exports;
const result = await toolFunc(input);
This assumes tool code uses module.exports or similar. You might enforce that format when saving code.
Integrate with chat: Allow the user to instruct Sophia to use a tool. A straightforward way: If user says something like “Use tool X with input Y” or triggers some known pattern, the backend can intercept that and call the tool directly, then respond with output. However, a more organic integration is to let the AI decide. Initially, you can parse user commands that start with a special prefix (like /run toolName {json}). Implement a simple parser for that. This gives power users direct control even before AI is fully autonomous with tools.
Tool creation via chat: Support a command or flow where the user can provide code. Perhaps define a special sequence: if the user message starts with something like /tool name=XYZ followed by code in markdown, treat it as a new tool definition. But a nicer way is to have the AI assist (Phase 4 or 5). For now, you can add a hidden UI element to manually input a tool for testing. For example, a debug route /api/devtools could load some sample tools (like adder or a helloWorld).
Test tool execution with a safe example. For instance, make a sayHello tool that just returns "Hello, " + input.name. Call it via chat and see that the assistant returns the correct result. Debug any context scoping issues (Node vm can be tricky with requiring modules; you might have to provide any needed libraries explicitly, or disallow them initially).
Phase 4: AI-assisted Tool Creation & Editing
Allow Sophia to generate and modify tool code through the chat interface (continuation of Feature 2).
Now that tools can run, let’s enable creation via AI. Use the main LLM (ideally GPT-4 if available, because coding accuracy is important) to generate tool code. This involves a prompt template like: “User wants a tool to do X. Here is the JSON format for tools: ... Please provide a JSON definition for the tool named Y.” You might include examples in the prompt to guide format.
When the AI returns the code (most likely as a JSON or just a code block), catch that in the backend or parse it from the assistant’s message in the frontend. Possibly easiest is to have the assistant output just the JavaScript code (inside markdown triple backticks). The frontend can detect a code block in the assistant’s message (using the ReactMarkdown AST or a regex) and mount a Monaco editor with that code. Provide a UI element for the user to confirm saving this as a tool (maybe a “Save Tool” button). On save, send the code along with meta info (name, etc., which might need to be parsed from the code or from the conversation) to the backend’s add-tool function.
Monaco integration: Add a state like editingToolCode in the App to hold code being edited. When a code block is detected in an assistant message and we expect it’s a tool, populate editingToolCode. Render a <MonacoEditor> (perhaps in a modal or overlay) with that code. Once the user clicks save, call backend, then close the editor.
Support editing existing tools similarly: user says “edit tool X”, Sophia could output the current code (backend fetches it and the assistant presents it, or just directly open the editor with the code). Then after changes, save back.
Auto-trigger tool creation: Implement the logic described to detect when a query cannot be answered. One approach: after each assistant generation, check if the assistant output contains a phrase like “I cannot do X” or a known pattern. But a more reliable method: maintain a list of known tool names and capabilities. If the user asks for something that matches none of them and appears to be an actionable request, flag it. This might involve basic NLP or just keywords (e.g. “file”, “email”, “calculate” etc., if not supported, then propose tool). Alternatively, allow the LLM to output a special action like <create_tool name="X"> in its response, which you intercept. This is a bit advanced – maybe leave it for a later iteration when you have more trust in the AI’s ability to know it needs a tool.
Test case: Tell Sophia: “I need to translate text to Morse code” (assuming no such tool exists). Ideally, Sophia should either say “I can create a tool for that” and generate it. Walk through that and ensure it works.
Phase 5: Workflow Chaining
Implement the Workflow composer (Feature 3).
Ensure you have a couple of tools to test chaining (like two or three simple tools that logically chain: e.g., one that fetches data, one that processes data, one that outputs result).
Develop an internal representation for a plan. Possibly create a class Workflow that has steps as described.
Integrate with the conversation: perhaps if the user asks something complex, initially just have the assistant respond with a plan text (you can manually craft an example for testing: “Step 1 do X, Step 2 do Y”). Then implement a parser to read an assistant message that outlines steps into a data structure. This could be as simple as reading numbered lines from its reply. However, since you control both sides in development, you might not need to parse free text – you can prompt the AI to output JSON for the plan. E.g., “Respond only with a JSON of the plan like: {steps: [ {tool: '', input: {}}, ...]}”. That would make it easier to consume.
Create a UI element for confirmation: when a plan is proposed (say you have a workflowPlan object ready), you can present a nice formatted list in the chat. Possibly include a “Run Workflow” button. If confirmed, call a backend function to execute it. If not, allow user to modify (maybe they can edit the message if it was JSON or just tell Sophia to change something and regenerate the plan).
Implement the executeWorkflow function in backend: loop through steps, for each step call runTool with given input (resolving any references to previous outputs). Store outputs in a dictionary by tool name or step index. E.g., after step1, context.outputs["step1"] = result1 or context.outputs["organizeNotes"] = result1. Then if step2 input says "body": "{{organizeNotes}}" (you could allow a templating like that), replace it with the actual output from context.
Handle errors: wrap each in try/catch; if one fails, abort and send a message to the user indicating failure at step N.
If successful, either send each step’s result as it happens (streaming workflow logs), or accumulate and send a final message. A good UX might be:
Sophia: “Running Step 1...” (and maybe some loading indicator)
After step 1 done: “✅ Step 1 completed. Output summary: ...”
“Running Step 2...”
After all done: “All steps done! Result: ...” This can be achieved by sending multiple assistant messages or a single message edited dynamically. Simpler is sequential messages. The frontend already handles multiple messages; just ensure to append them in the right order. You might not have streaming token by token here, but step-by-step updates.
Finally, ask user if they want to save it as a new tool. If yes, auto-generate the tool code that wraps it (as discussed) and go through the tool creation process (maybe behind the scenes or with confirmation). This essentially means Phase 5 can produce content for Phase 4’s system (the code editor) if you want the user to vet it.
Phase 6: Tone/Personality and Backgrounds
Implement mood detection and dynamic styling (Features 4 & 5).
Sentiment model: Set up the chosen sentiment classifier. If using Ollama with a model, you might need to fine-tune or prompt-engineer it to reliably output a single-word mood. Alternatively, use a smaller model like DistilBERT sentiment (if you find an offline one). For initial dev, you could use a placeholder like a simplistic keywords approach (e.g., if message contains “!” or all caps -> angry, if contains “thanks” -> positive, etc.) just to test the pipeline.
In backend, after receiving user message and before generating a reply, determine the mood. Then decide Sophia’s tone. Create a mapping: e.g., if userMood == 'negative': sophiaTone = 'empathetic'; else if userMood == 'positive': sophiaTone = 'friendly'; .... Also watch for explicit overrides (maybe maintain a variable that if user said /tone flirty, it locks Sophia in flirty until further notice, regardless of user sentiment).
Adjust the assistant’s system prompt or persona: you can have a base persona text (like “You are Sophia, a helpful assistant.”) and append tone-specific text as described. Implement this in the prompt assembly before calling the main LLM.
Front-end style: Extend Message interface to include a tone property. When setting messages in state, attach the current tone to the assistant message. Then in ChatMessage component, use that to apply a CSS class. You might define classes in CSS for each tone (e.g. .tone-flirty { background-color: #fff0f5; } etc., or an icon). Even without visuals, could prefix the message with an emoji to denote tone for debugging. Ensure it’s subtle and not too distracting.
Background generation: Install an HTTP client like Axios. Write a function generateBackground(mood: string): Promise<string> that crafts a prompt and calls the SD API. Test this function independently by calling it with various moods and verifying you get an image (you can save the base64 to a file to see it works). You might need to set up CORS or proxy if calling from the browser; better call from Node where CORS is not an issue.
In the chat flow, when Sophia’s tone changes or at certain intervals, call this function. Because image generation is slower, do not await it during the message response. Instead, do it in parallel:
After sending the text reply to frontend, spawn an async task to get the image. Once done, either send it via a WebSocket event or perhaps the next assistant message contains a special flag to update background.
Frontend: Modify GradientBackground to accept an image prop or use a global context. Implement the transition effect for changing the background. Possibly use Framer Motion’s AnimatePresence to fade out the old image and fade in the new one.
Testing: Try triggering background changes manually first (e.g., have a button in UI to cycle backgrounds for each tone). Then integrate with actual tone detection: simulate a user message that should cause a tone shift. Check that after the assistant response, the background image changes accordingly.
Tweak the prompts for Stable Diffusion as needed to get visually pleasing results. It might be helpful to keep them somewhat abstract or artistic so that the background doesn’t steal focus (and also to avoid any NSFW or literal content from an “uncensored” model).
Phase 7: Reflection and External Integration
Implement idle reflections and SMS/Telegram features (Features 6 & 7).
Reflection: Add a global timer in the backend on startup (using setInterval). Alternatively, use Node’s schedule (or node-cron if you prefer CRON syntax) to check every minute. If Date.now() - lastUserMessageTime > idleThreshold and a reflection not yet done for this interval, call a function doReflection().
Implement doReflection() to compile necessary info:
Summarize conversation: you can reuse the main LLM (with a prompt like “Summarize the chat so far in 5 sentences”). Or use a smaller model if available. If the conversation is very long and local model context is limited, you might truncate or vector-search for key points.
Analyze tools: Perhaps check the tools list for any that were created but not used yet, or any errors logged. The reflection could mention those: e.g., “The email tool was created but not tested.”
Potential improvements: This is open-ended. You could prompt GPT-4: “Given the above chat and tool list, suggest one improvement or next step.” to get a sentence or two.
Format the reflection message nicely. Possibly as a blockquote or italic text to differentiate. For example: “(Sophia spends some time in thought...) Reflection: I noticed we have covered A, B, C. Perhaps we could try D next. Also, I created a tool for X that might be useful later.”
Post this as an assistant message in the chat. Maybe also log it to a file if persistent logging is desired.
If using SMS/Telegram: after posting in chat, also send an external notification. The content of SMS could be just a high-level note (the reflection might be too long). You could do: "Sophia: I summarized our session and have ideas for later. Text me back when you're ready to continue." or include a short snippet of the reflection. Use Twilio client to send SMS​
TWILIO.COM
. For Telegram, use bot API sendMessage.
SMS inbound: Set up the Express route for Twilio webhook (e.g., /sms-hook). Use body-parser to parse application/x-www-form-urlencoded (Twilio default) or JSON if configured. Verify the incoming Twilio signature (optional for security) or at least the From number. If it matches user’s number, take Body and feed it to the chat handler as if it was user input. Perhaps prepend a special marker internally (like [SMS]) to note the source. Generate the response using existing pipeline. Once a response is ready, send it via Twilio API to the From number. You likely should not send it to the UI (unless you want the UI to also show the SMS conversation – which could be cool so the user sees what happened via SMS when they return). That can be done by treating the SMS input and output as normal chat messages so they end up in history.
Telegram inbound: If chosen, set up the bot and use a library or polling. It will be similar: on receiving a message from the user, call the chat logic, then use sendMessage to reply.
Test the SMS feature thoroughly: using a real phone if possible. Send an SMS to the Twilio number, see if your backend logs it and responds. Check the phone receives the reply. Try a simple tool run or query over SMS. If the user asks for something requiring a tool creation while remote, consider how to handle that – likely you’d postpone actual coding until user is back, or send a “I need to create a tool for that, will do it once you’re back at the console” because coding via SMS is not practical.
Phase 8: Polish and Fallbacks
Finalize the system, handle edge cases.
Go through each feature and think of offline fallback behaviors:
If the main LLM (GPT-4 via API) is not available (no internet or no API key), ensure a local model (like Llama2 13B) is loaded via Ollama to answer. This might have a lower quality, so adjust prompts accordingly. Possibly allow the user to configure which model to use for chat – via a config file or environment variable.
Embeddings: if the embedding model is missing, catch that error and maybe default to a simpler keyword search in memory as a last resort.
Vector DB: if Chroma is not running, perhaps fall back to an in-memory array with a naive search (compute cosine similarity in JS). This is not too hard to implement for small scales and can be a quick backup so the assistant still works.
Stable Diffusion: as mentioned, if no image can be generated, just keep the current background and maybe log a message like “(image generator offline)”.
Twilio/Telegram: wrap any network calls in try/catch so that if the internet is down or credentials invalid, it won’t crash the app. Maybe log “SMS send failed” and continue.
Improve the user interface:
Display list of available tools and workflows somewhere (maybe a collapsible sidebar or a chat command /tools that prints them in chat).
Possibly allow uploading files for tools to process (like for a PDF tool, user might upload a PDF through the UI).
Make the chat interface prettier for different tones (could change the background color of the message bubble or font style). This can be done via CSS as mentioned.
Add an avatar image for Sophia for more personality (optional: could be an SVG or an image that also changes with tone).
Testing and Debugging: Write scenarios to test each major feature combination. E.g.:
Create a tool and then use it in a workflow.
Reflection triggers while in a certain tone – does it reset tone or maintain it?
Rapid-fire messages from user – does memory retrieval still pick up long-term memories properly?
Are there any memory leaks or performance issues (like if we generate many images, ensure to clear old ones if not needed to free memory).
Documentation: Document how to run the backend (which ports, any setup like starting SD or Ollama, Twilio keys, etc.). Also document in-app commands for power users (like any slash commands).
By following these phases, each milestone produces a working increment of Sophia:
By Phase 2, you have a basic chat with memory.
Phase 3-4 introduces the powerful extensibility through tools.
Phase 5 adds automation of tasks.
Phase 6 delights with personality and visuals.
Phase 7-8 add the finishing touches for a truly smart personal assistant.
Throughout development, keep user experience in mind: the system should remain responsive and not overwhelm the user with complexity unless they ask for it. For example, tool creation and workflows are advanced features – ensure the assistant explains what it’s doing in simple terms, so non-developers aren’t confused by seeing code or JSON unexpectedly. Perhaps Sophia can say “I’ve written some code to help with that. Would you like to review it?” to make the process transparent. Finally, since all components run locally, the user retains full control. This means they can also inspect logs, tweak configuration, or even edit Sophia’s own code. Encouraging user feedback will help refine Sophia’s capabilities over time. With this blueprint, we have a comprehensive plan to implement Sophia’s features in a structured manner, ensuring each part integrates smoothly with the rest of the system.
